    # pocket1: BookSecurity | Floof - M3739 - If sec's lawyer, the prosecutor, doesn't have one, why should the lawyer have it? Yoink until we get Space Law in a book.
    pocket2: RubberStampLawyer # Floof - M3739 - DeltaV's Lawyer stamp addition is now a pocket item instead to ensure deployment across loadouts. ClothingBackpackLawyerFilled and it's variants don't really work when people can choose their bags.
