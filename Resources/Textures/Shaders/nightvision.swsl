// Floof - M3739 - This shader has been altered with inputs and advice gathered from LLMs. I'm going to tell you right 
// now, this is ARCANE to me. I hate math, I hate this. I have the technical intuition to figure out logic and mechanica
// but god forbid if I ever have to figure out a mathmatical formula to draw a CIRCLE. I suck at this. I hate that I did
// this to achieve the results I wanted. This comment has been left here because I am angry at myself. I have sinned.
// Also, this shader is heavily modified for Floof, cherry-picked from Einstein Engines PR No. 1492. While the file
// itself originates from WWDP.
