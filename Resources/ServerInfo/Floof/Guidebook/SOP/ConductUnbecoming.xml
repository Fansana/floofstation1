# Conduct Unbecoming

[head=3][color=#ff0000]Last Updated 12 FEB 2025. THE WIKI IS AUTHORITATIVE. This is intended as an in-game reference only and may be out of date.[/head][/color]

NanoTrasen personnel found to behave or act in a way that is broadly considered or specified by superiors as inappropriate, unacceptable, or contrary to our company’s standards and expectations for their position or profession, particularly in a professional capacity or when representing the company as a whole, may be demoted from that position or profession, have their contract terminated, or be otherwise reprimanded for their unbecoming conduct.

Behaviour that violates our company’s values and policies, our employees’ character, integrity, and suitability; additionally, improper conduct reflects poorly on our management. As such, [bold]Departmental Heads[/bold] are [italic]fully authorized and encouraged to demote employees who discredit our company’s values through poor behaviour and demeanour.[/italic]
