# Appearance Standards

[head=3][color=#ff0000]Last Updated 12 FEB 2025. THE WIKI IS AUTHORITATIVE. This is intended as an in-game reference only and may be out of date.[/head][/color]

As a NanoTrasen employee, you are expected to wear provided clothing and keep it clean, well-maintained, and appropriately fitted. This ensures that you represent our brand in a professional manner and maintain the safety of yourself and others in the station environment. 

## Uniforms and Attire

Wear the uniforms and attire provided to you by NanoTrasen. Take care of your clothes, and wear them with pride. Additionally, in Sector Floof, there are a variety of different clothing tailor-made for the department. It is acceptable to wear these, so long as the individuals for that department remain identifiable. 

## Grooming

Maintain high standards of personal hygiene and grooming. Neat hair and well-kept appearances contribute to a professional atmosphere and boost first impressions. 

## Accessories and Personal Items

Limit the use of accessories that might interfere with safety equipment or delegated tasks. Personal items should be stored in designated spaces to avoid clutter and ensure your and your coworkers' safety. 

## Personal Protective Equipment

Wear the appropriate PPE as required by your role, any safety notices, or instructions from authorities. The safety of our employees and customers is paramount. 

## Respect and Consideration

When expressing yourself and your personal style, be mindful of others’ cultures, beliefs, and other qualities. Your behaviour and actions should respect the sensitivities and beliefs of others. Additionally, it should be noted that any accessory, item of clothing or apparel, or other cosmetic possession that promotes or depicts obscene or hateful content, criminal or terrorist groups, or illegal and unethical acts is unacceptable for our employees to wear. Failure to uphold our company’s values by violating this rule will result in disciplinary action.
