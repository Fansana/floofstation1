# Mutiny Guidelines

[head=3][color=#ff0000]Last Updated 16 FEB 2025. THE WIKI IS AUTHORITATIVE. This is intended as an in-game reference only and may be out of date.[/head][/color]

## Incompetence or Inability 
## of the Commanding Officer

Should the station's Commanding Officer, such as the Captain appointed by NanoTrasen, become unfit for their duties, such as allowing damages to the station to go unmanaged or that crew becomes endangered or harmed through their incompetence or inability to lead and delegate, the Departmental Heads on the station can initiate a vote of No Confidence.

When it is reasonably believed and backed by evidence that the Captain or Commanding Officer has acted to the detriment of the station, the Departmental Heads will hold a vote that requires a majority in order to depose the Captain or Commanding Officer non-lethally and remove them from their position. Once this is done, Central Command must  be faxed about the circumstances; the Departmental Heads do not need any more instructions.

The Captain or Commanding Officer must vacate the position once the Majority has ruled against them. However, if the vote does not go into Majority, the Captain or Commanding Officer cannot depose the Departmental Heads who voted against them. They must find a means to de-escalate the situation.

## True Mutiny

When the Crew deems that their Departmental Heads and Captain are a significant detriment to how the station is run, there should be a majority vote that takes place, and the Leader of this Mutiny must  fax Central Command of their grievances and Central Command may try to address it when available. The crew must not hold a strike, declare independence, or withhold how the station can operate; they must work with Central Command to rectify the issue.
