On Space Station 14, stations operate under abbreviated space law. All crew, passengers, and visitors aboard the station are expected to follow these laws.

Foreign invaders, such as nuclear operatives, ninjas, and pirates, are not protected under space law. Traitors are not foreign invaders so are usually protected by space law.

In some sectors; the term 'Sophont' is used to describe any entity with human level of intelligence. Designation of 'Sophont' does not automatically grant protections under Space Law within the Floof Station Sector.
