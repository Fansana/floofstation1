[color=#a4885c]2.3[/color] Department strikes (e.g. cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults require explicit administrator pre-approval, and lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.

[color=#ffff00]Section 6: Roleplay Roles[/color]
[color=#a4885c]6.1[/color] Your character is a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences rather than your own as the player.
[color=#a4885c]6.2[/color] Do not become excessively hostile in-character, respond to a situation realistically - Ahelp for any questions relating to this.

[color=#a4885c]6.4[/color] Respect other people's consent, dignity and boundaries. IF SOMEBODY ASKS YOU TO STOP BOTHERING THEM LOOC (local-out-of-character), do so. If this rule is abused, Ahelp right away.
[color=#a4885c]6.5[/color] Non-security personnel should not seek to kill or detain antagonistic players or aggressive mobs unless to defend against station threats such as: nuclear operatives, a zombie outbreak, a space dragon attack, or any other critical situation (such as all Command or/and Security being dead) requiring the crew to take matters in their own hands.
[color=#a4885c]6.6[/color] By picking the prisoner/gladiator role, you have chosen to roleplay as a prisoner/gladiator, NOT an antagonist, and should not act so in any capacity.
[color=#a4885c]6.7[/color] Mindbreaking is NOT murder, do not refuse to do your job.
[color=#a4885c]6.8[/color] Do not dismantle station escape pods.




[color=#ffff00]Section 7: Powergaming Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]7.3[/color] Do not hide Antag objective items.
[color=#a4885c]7.4[/color] Do NOT, under any circumstances, hide the nuclear fission explosive, authentication disk in an impossible-to-see/access location.
[color=#a4885c]7.5[/color] While it is allowed for the crew to know the details around the various antagonist functions (traitor items being such, PDAs having uplinks, listening posts existing, etc.), it is strictly forbidden from acting on that information without valid reason and suspicion, and you are always to presume innocence until proven guilty. For example, you shouldn't check PDAs, implants, and headsets, unless the person is strongly suspected to be a syndicate agent, and there is evidence to back this up.
[color=#a4885c]7.6[/color] Do not exploit game mechanics or bugs to circumvent roleplay for example: Game mechanic -> Putting on thieving gloves to test for chameleon fibers. Bug -> Slipping under a windoor.

[color=#a4885c]9.3[/color] DO NOT use ERP as bait for kill objectives, unless done with OCC consent of all parties involved. After the ERP is complete, a grace period of 5 minutes is in effect, during which you are still NOT allowed to kill the target.

[color=#a4885c]9.6[/color] Do not spam or pollute radio channels (including the telepath channel) with NSFW topics. Mind you, this does NOT mean that you are not allowed to speak or discuss such. There should not be a cringy spamfest of: shitposting, hornyposting, or depression posting.
[color=#a4885c]9.7[/color] Do not engage in, nor discuss, ‘extreme’  sexual fetishes in public. Public includes: any radio channel (including the telepath channel), out loud speech or overt actions in actual public physical locations, or doing so on camera.
[color=#a4885c]9.8[/color] Do not kinkshame.
[color=#a4885c]9.9[/color] Roleplaying a character as underage is strictly forbidden. So is talk of such activities.
[color=#a4885c]9.10[/color] Engaging in ERP with a feral, non-sentient creature is prohibited. The creature must be player-controlled; consent in OOC, and pass the Harkness test in character.
[color=#a4885c]9.11[/color] Extreme acts such as killing, severely maiming, nonconning, abuse, or even round removal are allowed, so long that all the participants consented OOC, Ahelp if you need clarification (Keep it private).
