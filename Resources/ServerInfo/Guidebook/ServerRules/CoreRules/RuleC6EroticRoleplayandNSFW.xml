[color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 6: Erotic-Role-Play (ERP) and NSFW[/head][/color] 

[color=#a4885c]6.1[/color] Do not kinkshame, nor shame people for resonable provocative or sexual conduct. 

[color=#a4885c]6.2[/color] Roleplaying a character as underage is strictly forbidden. So is talk of such activities. 

[color=#a4885c]6.3[/color] Any creature and being that is or was not player-controlled (including but not limited to: humanoid NPCs, non-humanoid NPCs, and the corpses of either), is to be considered off-limits for any form of ERP (and roleplay involving controversial, heavy themes). 

[color=#a4885c]6.4[/color] Public roleplay (in speech and in action) of controversial, heavy themes and topics that would make most people uncomfortable, such as self harm, mental health or rape, is forbidden. Always ensure OOC consent from all parties involved. Public includes: any radio channel (including the telepath channel), out-loud speech, and overt actions in actual public physical locations, or doing so on camera. Ask in AHelp if you are unsure of whether the theme or topic may be a little too extreme to be public. 

[color=#a4885c]6.5[/color] Public roleplay (in speech and in action) of "extreme" sexual fetishes is forbidden. Always ensure OOC consent from all parties involved. Ask in AHelp if you are unsure of whether the fetish may be a little too extreme to be public. 

[color=#a4885c]6.6[/color] You must use the (-) subtle and whisper commands for any and all ERP material, unless the area is explicitly sanctioned by admins as a "public ERP area" or is a remote space dedicated to it. Public ERP is allowed, so long it follows this rule and is also done in a subtle, inconspicuous manner. 

[color=#a4885c]6.7[/color] Do not spam or pollute radio channels (including the telepath channel) with NSFW topics, nor exaggerate with loud, public, NSFW talk. Please note that this does not mean you are not allowed to speak or discuss of such. Only overdoing it to the point it's making many people uncomfortable is against the rules. 

[color=#a4885c]6.8[/color] Do not use ERP as bait for kill objectives, unless done with OOC consent of all parties involved. 

[color=#a4885c]6.9[/color] While usage of kinks or sex mechanics for for gameplay or non-sexual roleplay purposes is not forbidden per se, usage of them should still not be done in a way that breaches other rules. Furthermore, involvement of "extreme" kinks still requires the scene to be kept to a private space, and should consider that because of this, certain scenes may inevitably break certain rules. For example, using vore mechanics to hide yourself and your loot from Security, being normally a breach of powergaming and metagaming rules, due to ERP protection etiquette and this forcing others to interact with an extreme kink (resulting in potential consent violations). If you are ever unsure of something, or got a particular idea, ask an Admin via AHelp. 

[color=#a4885c]6.10[/color] While it is common etiquette to not directly disturb ERP in progress and ERP areas, in case of necessity, interruptions and disturbances are permitted (for example, Security finding that an antagonist is ERPing with somebody in a dorm and barging in to arrest). This applies especially to Antagonist roles, who should strongly refrain from direct disturbances and interruptions unless absolutely necessary (or unless it's consensual). Indirect disturbances however (i.e. setting off the nuke, cutting power/gravity, taking over the station, etc.), are absolutely permitted.
