[color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 2: Consent[/head][/color] 

[color=#a4885c]2.1[/color] Both roleplay and ERP require all players involved to be consenting, either through IC or OOC means. If your OOC consent is not respected, immediately AHelp or open a ticket. 

[color=#a4885c]2.2[/color] Roleplay may occur under implied consent when all players involved engage in roleplay that suggests mutual willingness with no OOC objections raised during or immediately after the interaction. However, if at any point one of the players expresses discomfort or objects OOC, the roleplay must stop immediately. The same applies to ERP as well. 

[color=#a4885c]2.3[/color] Be mindful of the differences between in-character and out-of-character consent. While roleplay without consent of the character is allowed and not necessarily against the rules, OOC consent is always mandatory and must always be established and clearly ascertained. 

[color=#a4885c]2.4[/color] It is your responsibility to keep your consent preferences up to date. This is especially important in the event some relatively common actions, topics or preferences (i.e. physical contact, sex talk, gender preferences, etc.) are not of your liking, in order to prevent both you from being accidentally upset, and others from needing to walk on eggshells. 

[color=#a4885c]2.5[/color] While usage of kinks or sex mechanics for gameplay or non-sexual roleplay purposes is not forbidden per se, you must seek consent from everybody who may end up or ended up involved in that scene before roleplaying it out. This is especially important in the event "extreme" kinks are involved. 

[color=#a4885c]2.6[/color] For any role involving you taking over the body or/and appearances of somebody else's character, OOC consent from the original (the owner of said character) is mandatory if you mean to engage in ERP or other controversial forms of RP with it.
