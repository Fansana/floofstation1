  [color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 9: General Roles and Jobs[/head][/color]

  [color=#a4885c]9.1[/color] If you choose a job on shift, you are required to participate in the round as said job when necessary. If you are requested or needed, you must respond or return to your duties ASAP. Do not ignore calls or emergencies. ERP does not take priority over your job. This is especially important for Command and Security jobs.

  [color=#a4885c]9.2[/color] If you are banned from a role or a department, you may not play that role or job. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from, and taking ghost roles allowing you to play out the job or role in question.

  [color=#a4885c]9.3[/color] Try not to engage in tasks that do not fall under the purview of your job. Doing something in a pinch is alright, and so is helping out someone that you see is struggling a bit. But otherwise, let each role do their job. Exceptions can be made for emergencies, during severe personnel shortages in a department, and for some Service duties (for example, playing music at bar in place of the musician, bartend for central bars despite not being a bartender, or cleaning your department yourself).

  [color=#a4885c]9.4[/color] By picking the prisoner/gladiator role, you have chosen to roleplay as a prisoner/gladiator, NOT an antagonist, and you should not act as such in any capacity. This includes (but is not limited to) any attempt at breaking out without reasonable emergency or need or admin approval, staging riots, or killing Security or fellow prisoners (obvious exception being, gladiator fights to the death).

  [color=#a4885c]9.5[/color] Ghost roles have their own independent rules that must be followed.

  [color=#a4885c]9.6[/color] Department strikes (i.e. Cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other such events, require explicit administrator approval.
