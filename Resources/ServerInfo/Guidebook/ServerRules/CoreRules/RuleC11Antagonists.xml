[color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 11: Antagonists[/head][/color] 

[color=#a4885c]11.1[/color] Antagonistic roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay. 

[color=#a4885c]11.2[/color] Damage by any antagonist role must be proportional to their related objectives, and be pertinent to their objectives. Rarely if ever, station-wide destruction and mass killing is justifiable. Ask an Admin via AHelp if you are unsure of whether the level of damage you want to cause is acceptable or not. 

[color=#a4885c]11.3[/color] Antagonists must follow a 30 minutes grace period from round start. 

[color=#a4885c]11.4[/color] Playing a normally hostile ghost role as a friendly is permitted. However, it is strongly advised to seek permission from an admin if you wish to do so. This way, the admin may help in clarifying your friendly status. Else, you will be liable for being killed or attacked on sight (so long of course proper escalation, reasoning and roleplay is followed by the attacker). Furthermore, by making this choice, you are forbidden from switching back to playing it as an hostile role without extremely good motive, and are also forbidden from faking being friendly. 

[color=#a4885c]11.5[/color] Intentional round removal is forbidden, kill objectives being the only exception to this rule. 

[color=#a4885c]11.6[/color] The role of an antagonist is to make the game more fun, exciting and interesting, not miserable, unfun and frustrating. As such, try to play out the role accordingly, focusing not on winning, but on making things more thrilling and entertaining.
