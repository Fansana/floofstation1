  [color=#a4885c]6.1[/color] Your character is a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences rather than your own as the player.

  [color=#a4885c]6.2[/color] Do not become excessively hostile in-character, respond to a situation realistically - Ahelp for any questions relating to this.

  [color=#a4885c]6.3[/color] If someone is critically injured, players should seek medical help for them, if they die, do not destroy or hide their body.

  [color=#a4885c]6.4[/color] Respect other people's consent, dignity and boundaries. IF SOMEBODY ASKS YOU TO STOP BOTHERING THEM LOOC (local-out-of-character), do so. If this rule is abused, Ahelp right away.

  [color=#a4885c]6.5[/color] Non-security personnel should not seek to kill or detain antagonistic players or aggressive mobs unless to defend against station threats such as: nuclear operatives, a zombie outbreak, a space dragon attack, or any other critical situation (such as all Command or/and Security being dead) requiring the crew to take matters in their own hands.

  [color=#a4885c]6.6[/color] By picking the prisoner/gladiator role, you have chosen to roleplay as a prisoner/gladiator, NOT an antagonist, and should not act so in any capacity.

  [color=#a4885c]6.7[/color] Mindbreaking is NOT murder, do not refuse to do your job.

  [color=#a4885c]6.8[/color] Do not dismantle station escape pods.
