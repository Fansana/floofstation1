  [color=#a4885c]7.1[/color] Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job. If you, in your given role, require an item that does not fall within your jobâ€™s usual parameters, seek in-character RP methods to obtain them.

  [color=#a4885c]7.2[/color] Manufacturing weapons, bombs, deadly poisons, or structures before you know of any reason you would need them for is powergaming behavior.

  [color=#a4885c]7.3[/color] Do not hide Antag objective items.

  [color=#a4885c]7.4[/color] Do NOT, under any circumstances, hide the nuclear fission explosive, authentication disk in an impossible-to-see/access location.

  [color=#a4885c]7.5[/color] While it is allowed for the crew to know the details around the various antagonist functions (traitor items being such, PDAs having uplinks, listening posts existing, etc.), it is strictly forbidden from acting on that information without valid reason and suspicion, and you are always to presume innocence until proven guilty. For example, you shouldn't check PDAs, implants, and headsets, unless the person is strongly suspected to be a syndicate agent, and there is evidence to back this up.

  [color=#a4885c]7.6[/color] Do not exploit game mechanics or bugs to circumvent roleplay. For example: Game mechanic -> Putting on thieving gloves to test for chameleon fibers. Bug -> Slipping under a windoor.
