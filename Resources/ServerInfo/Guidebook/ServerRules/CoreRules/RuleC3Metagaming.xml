[color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 3: Metagaming[/head][/color] 

[color=#a4885c]3.1[/color] Do not metagame (i.e. using or sharing information that your character has no way of knowing or obtaining, such as knowledge on the exact loadouts of antagonists, or things seen or heard while dead). 

[color=#a4885c]3.2[/color] Do not use nor share in-character information gained by metacommunication. Discussion about current round is allowed on the Floof Station Discord server. Acting on information gained through this method however is strictly forbidden. 

[color=#a4885c]3.3[/color] Do not metagrudge nor metafriend (i.e. treating unfairly a character based on the OOC relationship with the player without valid IC reasons). 

[color=#a4885c]3.4[/color] Players are allowed to retain and share knowledge of past experiences and prior shifts. However, treating unfairly a character solely based on antagonist-related happenings outside of the current round, is forbidden (for example, treating someone with more or less suspicion or trust solely based on their character being often an antagonist or not). 

[color=#a4885c]3.5[/color] Players are allowed to form in-character relationships (friends, foes, or otherwise). However, providing high profile unfair advantages or disadvantages solely based on those IC relationships, is forbidden (for example, ignoring serious crimes, demoting, barring from services, giving out abnormally high access, handing out normally highly restricted items, etc.). If you are unsure or got a particular idea, ask in AHelp for approval. 

[color=#a4885c]3.6[/color] Use the text channels for their intended purpose (you may "subtle LOOC", namely the usage of the subtle command for private LOOC talk, if the command is unavailable).
