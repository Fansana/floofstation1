 * HOW 2 MAKE MARKINGS WITH MULTIPLE LAYERS
 * by Dank Elly
 *
 * So, since the dawn of SS14, markings have been a single layer.
 * This is fine, since most markings are simple in terms of how they appear on a mob.
 * Just a cool skin color, or a pattern, or something.
 *
 * Then, tails were added.
 * Tails are different, if you think about it!
 * They tend to hang from the body, and appear behind the mob from some angles, and
 * in front of the mob from others. No real way around it, otherwise it'll look wierd!
 *
 * But, markings are still a single layer, which means that all the images sit in the
 * stacked deck of cards that is our sprite layers. If a marking is set to be in the
 * Underwear layer, that marking will only ever be in the Underwear layer, no matter
 * which way you turn! Fine and all for most markings, but not for tails.
 *
 * The previous solution was to just cookie-cut out a human shape from some directions
 * of the tail sprites, then layer then on top of the mob, over clothes and such.
 * This worked! Sort of! It wouldnt support missing legs, it only worked if you were
 * wearing skin-tight jumpsuits, and it made it so that you can't have any fancy leg
 * shapes (digilegs my beloved~)
 *
 * However, SS13 had solved this years ago, which I am totally taking credit for cus
 * I made roughly this system for Goonstation! The solution here was to just use
 * two layers lmao! A layer for the tail from most angles, and a layer for the tail
 * when youre facing away. This is known as the Behind and Oversuit layers, cus one
 * goes behind the mob, the other goes over your suit (and ideally under the backpack).
 *
 * LOREDUMP OVER HOW TO MAKE IT DO THIS
 *
 * First, make your marking prototype as normal.
 *   Note, you'll need extra sprites for every layer you want to add.
 *   This includes things like colorable accessories, which will need to be
 *   added to the new layers as well.
 * Next, add in a 'layering' entry to the marking prototype.
 * Then, add in a new entry to the 'layering' dictionary, like so:
 *   layering:
 *     name_of_image: LayerToPutItIn
 *     name_of_another_image: LayerToPutItIn
 *   I'll have a complete example later, but this is the basic idea.
 *   The first part of the entry is what you put for the state of that sprite
 *     Its how the game knows which sprite to mess with!
 *   The second part is the layer you want to put it in.
 *     This points to an entry in the enum stored in this file:
 *       Content.Shared/Humanoid/HumanoidVisualLayers.cs
 *     Capitalization matters!
 * todo: a way to link the colorations between layers
 *
 * Heres an example from Resources/Prototypes/Floof/Entities/Mobs/Customization/Markings/debug.yml
 *
- type: marking
  id: TailDebugPro
  bodyPart: Tail
  markingCategory: Tail
  speciesRestriction: [Reptilian, SlimePerson, IPC, Rodentia, Vulpkanin, Felinid, Human, Oni]
  layering:
    tail_oversuit: TailOversuit <--------------\
    tail_behind: TailBehind   <----------------+--------\
  sprites:                                     |        |
  - sprite: _Floof/Mobs/Customization/debug.rsi |        |
    state: tail_oversuit   >-------------------/        |
  - sprite: _Floof/Mobs/Customization/debug.rsi          |
    state: tail_behind   >------------------------------/
